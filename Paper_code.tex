With the generalization of mobile terminals and diversification of Internet applications,
mobile multiservice multimode terminals (MMT) on which runs multiple services simultaneously will be more widespread in future wireless networks~\cite{MECsurvey,Cacheinsky}.  
However, single-structured wireless networks cannot satisfy the requirements of multiple services.
For example, voice service requires low delay while video service is sensitive to network bandwidth and jitter, web browsing service needs low packet loss, etc.
As the performance for different requirements differs among diverse networks,
heterogeneous wireless networks (HWN) are a promising approach to satisfy manifold requirements for multiple services\cite{het}. 
However, network handover in HWN is still an inevitable issue and faces many challenges, such as network selection and service continuity guarantee.
%This calls for the existence of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWN) with different characters to ensure the quality of user experience.




%On the one hand, network selection needs to satisfy varied service requirements of different kinds of services.    And different service has different requirement to network.For example, voice service requires low delay while video service is sensitive to network bandwidth and jitter, web browsing needs low packet loss. On the other hand, handover  mechanism directly influences the effectiveness and reliability of wireless network. In order to improve network handover performance, a multi-path transmission protocol (MPTCP) at the transport layer is used in~\cite{acmmptcp}. During the handover process, mobile device uses multiple subflows for data transmission and maintians at least one subflow to transmit data  achieves a seamless handover. 

%Network selection has the problems of comprehensiveness and decision delay.
%Consider an MMT in HWN, different service has different requirements to network. For example, voice service requires low delay while video service is sensitive to network bandwidth and jitter, web browsing needs low packet loss.

The existing literature~\cite{MCGDM,Utility-GDM,select,tutorial} has studied the network selection problem in HWN considering service requirements and user preference.
The work in~\cite{tutorial} discussed using neural networks to solve the network selection problem.
In~\cite{MCGDM}, the authors proposed a network selection algorithm called fuzzy multiple criteria group decision making that considers user preference.
The work in~\cite{Utility-GDM} proposed a utility based group decision making algorithm taking into account service requirements.  
%In~\cite{MCGDM} and~\cite{Utility-GDM}, the authors proposed network selection algorithms fuzzy MCGDM and Utility-GDM that only consider user preference or service requirements, respectively. 
The authors in~\cite{select} proposed a comprehensive network selection algorithm based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) which satisfies both user preference and service priority. 
However, most existing works~\cite{MCGDM,Utility-GDM,select} on network selection for multiple services deploy the handover decision on the MMT. This mechanism ignores the influence that user mobility takes to network handover, and complex calculations can also lead to large handover delay.  
Therefore, there is a need to perceive user mobility and calculate the target network with high speed computation. 
To this end, the work in~\cite{2interface}  applied software defined network (SDN) to support low delay network selection.
% Software defined network (SDN) can be applied to
%support low delay network selection~\cite{3GPP}.
In~\cite{speedup}, SDN control plane is deployed to collect real-time network attributes and mobility information to calculate the target network, thus reducing unnecessary handover and decreasing the handover delay.   
 
% However, this leads to a too subjective or rational decision. 
%Nevertheless, it has too large time complexity and is executed on the terminal, which leads to large handover delay.

% For multiple services circumstances, many algorithms only consider one perspective such as user preference~\cite{MCGDM} or service requirement~\cite{Utility-GDM}, which leads to a too subjective or rational decision. 

%Software defined network (SDN) is widely applied to support low delay network selection determination.
%In SDN architecture, real-time network attributes and user mobility information can be collected to control plane and be computed for MMT's network selection~\cite{3GPP}. 
%In~\cite{speedup}, the SDN controller is deployed to collect information from both users and base stations to select network in advance, thus decrease handover time.
%The author in~\cite{2interface} proposed a handover scheme based on SDN. Using two network interfaces, the throughput is increased and handover delay is reduced. 

The use of multi-path transmission control protocol (MPTCP) for handover was studied in~\cite{acmmptcp, phone,MPTCP, Tsinghua}. 
Generally, vertical handover in HWN suffers from short-time service interruption.
%service disruption for a while in HWN.    
MPTCP is a new transport layer protocol that can guarantee service continuity during handover by using multiple paths for data transmission~\cite{acmmptcp}.
Mobile devices, such as Samsung Galaxy S6 and Apple iPhone 7 have begun to support MPTCP so as to increase traffic throughput~\cite{phone}. 
%According to to, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Apple iOS 7 mobile operating system have begun to support MPTCP protocol and the experiment result shows its ability to increase traffic throughput~\cite{phone}.
In~\cite{MPTCP}, the authors discussed MPTCP as a potential solution to address handoff-related and mobility-related service continuity issues.
% MPTCP is a new transport layer protocol with complete data flow management mechanism using multiple paths for data transmission. 
The work in~\cite{Tsinghua} proposed a seamless handover mechanism in SDN architecture using MPTCP, where mobile devices can maintain at least one subflow connected thus achieving seamless handover. 
Considering the ability to adapt to dynamic link change, MPTCP can be applied in multiservice scenarios for service continuity. 

%  However, none of these works~\cite{phone, MPTCP, Tsinghua} analyzed the potential of using MPTCP in multiple services scenario. 

%\color{black}
%However, these work didn't consider vertical handover in HWN.
%In SDN architecture, network selection calculation can be executed on network side~~\cite{3GPP} which has enough calculate capability.
% This method can ensure quality of service (QoS) and balance network access load rationally.   
%Until now, 
%much research work has been done on network selection. 
% there has been many mature agorithms for HWN network selection problem such as fuzzy logic and neural network based methods ~\cite{select12}~\cite{select13}, but these only consider one type of service requirement.  
%Many network selection algorithms only consider a single service in HWN ~~\cite{select12}~~\cite{select13}, but not consider multiservice's different requirement for MMT network selection. 
%As for  network selection for multiservice, many algorithms only consider one perspective such as user preference~\cite{MCGDM} or service requirement~\cite{Utility-GDM}, which leads to too subjective or rational decision. 
%The work in~\cite{select} proposed a comprehensive network selection algorithm based on fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (FAHP) which satisfies both user preference and service priority. Nevertheless, it has too large time complexity   and is executed on terminal, which leads to handover delay.

%~~\cite{speedup} proposed a handover cell selection scheme through SDN and reduce handover delay efficiently.
%~~\cite{2interface} proposed a handoff method on SDN and reduced the handover delay.


In this paper, we focus on multiservice network selection and subsequent handover mechanism in SDN based HWN.
To reduce the handover delay and achieve mobility management, the network selection decision process is deployed on SDN control plane, and MPTCP is applied to guarantee service continuity during handover.
The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 
\begin{itemize}

%\subsection{SDN tecture}

%SDN is designed to implement network virtualization, which separates data and control plane and provide network programming capbality. 
%Controller in control plane can monitor network situation and control data flow's  routing through Openflow switches as Fig. \ref{fig:sdn} shows.    
%In ~~\cite{3GPP}, 3GPP standardizes 5G network to use Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) in control plane to perceive user mobility.
%In SDN architecture network control plane has the ability to periodically collect information from networks and MMT, using these collected information, AMF can operate the network selection calculation at the network side then send MMT the target network signal message, which is an effective way to reduce the handover decision delay. 
% The architecture of SDN can be shown as Fig.~\ref{fig:HWN}.
Consider an SDN based heterogeneous wireless network is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HWN}. SDN separates network architecture into the control plane and data plane.
%In the network control plane, the network controller can monitor network conditions and control data flow routing through Openflow switches in data plane.
In~\cite{3GPP}, the control plane is standardized to own access and mobility management function (AMF) and
%In~\cite{3GPP}, 3GPP standardizes 5G network with access and mobility management function (AMF) in control plane to perceive user mobility. 
can periodically collect information from both networks and MMTs~\cite{speedup}. Using the collected information, 
the network control plane can run the network selection algorithm at the network side and instruct MMTs to hand over to the target network afterward.
Besides, 3GPP defines complete functions in SDN to support MPTCP, which promotes the MMTs to adapt to the dynamic connection during handover.   
 
The SDN based heterogeneous wireless networks consist of $M$ candidate networks, which are denoted by a set $\mathcal{R} =\left\{ {r}_1,\ldots ,r_{ M} \right\}$. The MMTs in the  network can associate with any candidate network and run a set $\mathcal{S}=\left\{s_1,\ldots,s_{Y} \right\}$  of $Y$ types of services.
%Consider an MMT is located in heterogeneous SDN networks shown as Fig. \ref{fig:HWN} and can associate with anyone of them. The network selection problem can be described as follows:

In the proposed model, different services have distinguished requirements.  
  The set of network attributes considered of network selection decision is given by $\mathcal{C}=\left\{c_1,\ldots,c_N\right\}$, where $N$ is the number of considered network attributes.

\section{Seamless handover method }
To solve the problem of vertical handover in SDN based heterogeneous wireless networks, in this paper, we propose a seamless handover method based on FAHP and MPTCP. Compared to existing network selection algorithms, FAHP based network selection algorithm takes into account service requirements, user preferences, and mobility management. Moreover, MPTCP based handover mechanism can maintain service continuity during handover. Next, we first introduce the detail of FAHP based network selection algorithm then discuss the mechanism for MPTCP to achieve seamless handover.
%In SDN wireless networks architecture, network selection scheme can be applied on network control plane to reduce decision delay. FAHP enables a comprehensive decision to satisfy both user and service requirements. MPTCP is efficient to realize seamless handover. 
% On these basis, we proposed a seamless handover method that can be regraded as to has two stages. In the handover decision stage, we use FAHP to take networks' condition, mobile terminal's information and user-specificed service priority into consideration. In the handover operation stage, we use MPTCP protocol to ensure the packet flow uninterrupted during network handover.

\subsection{FAHP Based Network Selection Algorithm}

FAHP is proposed by van Laarhoven and Pedrycz to deal with uncertainty in decision making problem~\cite{FAHP}. FAHP considers fuzziness among decision criteria by introducing fuzzy number. The fuzzy number indicates the relative importance between pairwise decision criteria, thus the decision making problem can be transformed into hierarchies with fuzzy numbers. 
Combining FAHP with user-specific service priority, network selection algorithm can make comprehensive decision considering both service requirements and user preferences.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

	\includegraphics[width = 0.4\textwidth,height = 0.21\textwidth]{figures/algorithmframe.eps}
	\caption{Network selection algorithm framework.}\label{fig:algorithmframe}
	\vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

The framework of FAHP based network selection algorithm is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:algorithmframe}. 
In the framework, service priority indicates user preferences for different services and can be specified by users.
 Taking the service characteristics into consideration, fuzzy decision matrices of diverse services are different. 
 Attribute weight $w_g^j$ are calculated from fuzzy decision matrices and indicate the absolute importance of attribute $c_j$ for service $s_{g}$, which can be stored at SDN control plane.
 %Calculated from fuzzy decision matrices, attribute weights indicate the absolute importance of attribute $c_j$ for service $s_{g}$, and it can be stored at network control plane.
% 描述  不同业务对于网络的属性需求不同
%Concretely, the voice service have higher requirement on cost, delay and jitter, but are not sensitive to the packet loss rate. Streaming service like video transimssion requires high bandwidth, little jitter, low price and packet loss but latency is more tolerable. As for web browsing service, the packet loss rate has the highest priority and latency, while jitter is not so important. 
Attribute utility functions are applied to normalize the network attributes, so the network attribute utility is limited between 0 and 1.
% The synthetic network score can be obtained through attribute weight multiplied by normalized attribute  and then weighted by service priority.
Then the SDN control plane selects the network with the highest synthetic score~(\ref{equ04}) as the target network and instructs MMTs to hand over to the target network with control signaling.
%send MMT corresponding handover signal message to instruct handover.

FAHP is applied to calculate the attribute weights $\boldsymbol{W}_g$. In this paper, we use the triangular fuzzy number (TFN) as the fuzzy number to represent relative importance between pairwise attributes. The TFN is defined as $\mu = (l,m,u), l \le m \le u$, where $l, m, u$ represent the lower limit value, the most favorable value, and the upper limit value, respectively. The correspondence between the relative importance of the attributes and TFN value is shown in Table \ref{tab1}. 


%TFN fuzzes the input value $x$ as follows:

%For further calculation, we first define the basic operations of TFN. 
Given $\mu_1=(l_1,m_1,u_1)$, $\mu_2=(l_2,m_2,u_2)$, 
The summation, multiplication, and reciprocal are defined as follows:
%Accordingly, the basic operation of TFN can be defined as follows:  Given $\mu_1=(l_1,m_1,u_1)$, $\mu_2=(l_2,m_2,u_2)$,
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ2}
{\mu _1} + {\mu _2}{\rm{ = }}\left( {{l_1} + {l_2},{m_1} + {m_2},{u_1} + {u_2}} \right) ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ3}
{\mu _1} \otimes {\mu _2}{\rm{ = }}\left( {{l_1} \times {l_2},{m_1} \times {m_2},{u_1} \times {u_2}} \right) ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ4}
\frac{1}{{{\mu _1}}}{\rm{ = }}\left( {\frac{1}{{{u_1}}},\frac{1}{{{m_1}}},\frac{1}{{{l_1}}}} \right)  .

% TFNs represent the relative importance of pairwise decision criteria,and each criteria's absolute weight can be calculated through FAHP.
 % FAHP integates these relative importance  and can calculate  based on service requirements. 
% The process to calculate service-specfic weight of each network attribute can be described as following 5 steps:
%Step 1: Transform the network selection problem into a hierarchy structure. The hierarchy has three layers, scheme layer, criterion layer and target layer. Scheme layer consists of each candidate network. Criterion layer includes 6 network attributes as decision criteria that is received signal strength, bandwidth, delay, jitter, packet loss rate and cost. Target layer is to select the best network.
%Step 2: Accroding to criterion layer, construct a fuzzy decision matrix $A^g$ for service $s_g$. Let $N$ be the number of network attributes, $A^g$ consists of TFNs can be shown as: 
  In this paper, we take into account 6 network attributes for network selection that is received signal strength (RRS), bandwidth, delay, jitter, packet loss rate, and cost. 
 %$A^g$ is.
 Let $N$ be the number of network attributes, the fuzzy decision matrix   $\boldsymbol{A}^g$ for service $s_g$ consists of TFNs can be shown as $\boldsymbol{A}^g = {({\mu _{ij}})_{N \times N}}   $.






\begin{comment}   
\label{equ5}
\boldsymbol{A}^g = {({\mu _{ij}})_{N \times N}}   .
\end{comment}   


As $\mu _{ij}$ represents the relative importance of attribute $c_i$ compared with $c_j$, it should hold consistency when compare $c_j$ with $c_i$, that is when $i \ne j$, $\mu_{ji} = 1 / \mu_{ij}$ and $\mu_{ii}=(1,1,3)$, $i,j=1\dots N$. 
 To ensure the consistency of the fuzzy decision matrix $\boldsymbol{A}^g$, FAHP introduces comprehensive fuzzy value $F_i$ of attribute $c_i$ to obtain its weight $w_g^i$.
$F_i$ is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ6}
{F_i} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {{\mu _{ij}}}  \otimes {\left[ {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {{\mu _{ij}}} } } \right]^{ - 1}}    .
\end{equation}  
%where ${\left[ {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {{\mu _{ij}}} } } \right]^{ - 1}} =\\
% \left( {\frac{1}{{\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {{u_{ij}}} } }},\frac{1}{{\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {{m_{ij}}} } }},\frac{1}{{\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {{l_{ij}}} } }}} \right)$.\\
Calculate the probability $V({F_j} \ge {F_i})$ which represents $F_j$ is larger than $F_i$ as follows: 
%Where $F_j$ and $F_i$ are the comprehensive fuzzy value of attributes $c_j$ and $c_i$ respectively. $V({F_j} \ge {F_i})$ is defined as:




\begin{equation}   
\label{equ7}
V({F_j} \ge {F_i}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
1\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;,{m_j} \ge {m_i},\\
\frac{{({m_j} - {u_j}) - ({m_j} - {l_i})}}{{{l_j} - {u_i}}}\;\;,{m_j} \le {m_i},{l_i} \le {u_j},\\
0\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;,\rm otherwise.
\end{array} \right.   
\end{equation}  
The weight value ${w^{j'}_g}$ of attribute $c_j$ for service $s_g$ can be defined by (\ref{equ8}) as the minimum probability that $F_j$ is larger than any other $F_i$ .

\begin{equation}   
\label{equ8}
\begin{array}{l}
{w_{g}^{j'}} = \min V({F_j} \ge {F_i}) = \min V({F_j} \ge {F_1},{F_2}, \ldots ,{F_N}),\\
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;j = 1, \ldots ,N  ,
\end{array} 
\end{equation}  
Then $w^j_g$ can be normalized by (\ref{equ9}) and satisfy $\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {w_{g}^{j}} {\rm{ = }}1$.  
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ9}
w^j_{g} = \frac{{w_{g}^{j'}}}{{\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^N {w_{g}^{j'}} }}{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} j = 1, \ldots ,N,
\end{equation} 
Through the above calculation, the final network attribute weight vector for service $s_g$ is obtained as $\boldsymbol{W}_g = [w_g^1,w_g^2, \ldots ,w_g^N]$.

The network attributes can be divided into benefit attributes and cost attributes. A larger benefit attribute value contributes to a higher network utility and vise versa. 
%In this paper, received signal strength (RRS) and bandwidth are benefit attributes, the others are cost attributes. 
% To normalize the network attributes, benefit attributes need a monotonically  increasing function and cost attributes  need a decreasing one. 
For attributes whose conditions have both lower and upper boundary, sigmoid utility function can be applied for normalization. 
Specifically, $f(x)$ is used for benefit attribute and $g(x)$ for cost attribute shown as follows:

\begin{equation}   
\label{equ10}
f(x) = \frac{1}{{1 + {e^{ - a(x - b)}}}}  ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ11}
g(x) = 1 - f(x)   ,
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $b$ are constant coefficients specified by service requirement for network attributes.
As for attributes with one boundary, linear and inverse proportional function can fit the attribute elasticity. $u(x)$ is used for benefit attributes and $h(x)$ is used for cost attributes shown as follows:
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ12}
u(x)=1-g/x ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}   
\label{equ13}
h(x) = 1 - g \cdot x  ,
\end{equation}
where $g$ is a constant coefficient to be specified according to the service requirement.

The raw  network attribute values collected by SDN control plane are constructed in a matrix form shown as (\ref{equ05}).
		\begin{comment}   
		\label{equ14}
		\boldsymbol{M}^t = {({m_{ij}})_{M \times N}}  ,
		\end{comment}
%where $M$ is the number of candidate networks and $N$ is the number of considered network attributes, the element $m_{ij}$ of matrix $\boldsymbol{M^t}$ is the collected real-time value of attribute $c_j$ in network $r_i$.
The utility functions and their coefficients are set diverse among different services shown in Table \ref{ufunc}. 
Then the network utility vector of service $s_g$ can be calculated from $\boldsymbol{M}^t $ through utility functions as $\boldsymbol{U}^i_g$. % = \left[ {u_g^{i,1},u_g^{i,2}, \ldots ,u_g^{i,N}} \right]$. 
The synthetic network score combines user-specific priority $p_g$, network attribute utility $\boldsymbol{U}_g^i$ and its weight $\boldsymbol{W}_g$.
 Given a candidate network set $\mathcal{R}$, the score $S_i$ of the networks $r_i$ is defined as (\ref{equ04}).
		\begin{comment}   
		\label{equ15}
		{S_i} = \sum_{g = 1}^Y {{p_g}}  \cdot \boldsymbol{W}_g \cdot {\boldsymbol{U}_g^i}^T	.
		\end{comment}
%where $g=1 \dots Y$, and ${p_g}$ %  \in \mathcal{P} $ 
%represents the normalized service priority of service $s_g$ specified by users. 
%and $\sum\nolimits_{g = 1}^Y {{p_g}} {\rm{ = }}1$. 
The target network is selected with the highest synthetic score to execute handover process. 

If MMT moves actively in a small range of network at a high speed $v$, the handover condition may be triggered frequently which decreases the user experience.
 As SDN control plane has the capacity to obtain user mobility information, a mobility-related handover mechanism can avoid this effect. Set the handover trigger threshold as follows:
\begin{equation} 
\label{equ16} 
\delta  = 1 + \frac{v + 1}{{(v + \beta)/\alpha  + 1}} ,
\end{equation}
 where $\alpha,\beta$ are constant coefficients and the value of $\delta$ increases as $v$ increases. Assume the MMT currently connects to network $r_i$ and its updated score is $S_i$, the target network is $r_t$ and its score is $S_t$. The handover process is set to be triggered only when $S_t/S_i > \delta$ is satisfied.

\subsection{MPTCP Based Handover Management Mechanism} 


%说明建立  添加机制 
%Similar to TCP, MPTCP connection is initiated by three-way handshake and both user equipment and server need to support MPTCP. As described in~\cite{MPTCP},  a moblie terminal such as smart phone can equip with a single cellular interface and a WiFi interface, MPTCP can use the $MP \_CAPABLE$ TCP option to establish a connection for cellular interface at first,
%as for WiFi interface, MPTCP can use $MP\_JOIN$ TCP option for an additional subflow connection.

To ensure reliability when delivering in-order data over multiple subflows. 
MPTCP configs 
 data connection level sequence number (DSN), per-subflow sequence number (SSN), and data sequence mapping (DSM) which maps SSN to DSN. 
The DSN indicates all the transmitted data and each SSN has its own space independent of the DSN. 
DSM is fixed once declared and is transmitted along with packet segment.
This ensures the same data in DSN can be mapped repeatedly and re-transmitted on different subflows when one subflow fails. 
These mechanisms enable a seamless handover in HWN~\cite{MPTCP}.


MPTCP prioritizes first-established subflows as master subflow and the following as slave subflows. 
With added subflow, MPTCP has more subflow policies that can be specified according to implementation. Take three of them for instance, 
alternate policy uses a second subflow when the master subflow is congested. 
Backup policy uses salve subflows as backups only if the master subflow fails. 
And in simultaneous policy, all subflows simultaneously send the same data in case of dynamical connection change. 
With these subflow polices, mobile users can use multiple subflows interchangeably for communication when comes in or out of the range of a particular network. 
The ability to simultaneously transmit data through multiple subflows allows for MPTCP connection to maintain available in case of handover.

Assume an MMT like smartphone equipped with a cellular interface and a WiFi interface moves into indoors from outdoors, when the cellular connection reaches an unusable level, the MMT can 
%, MMT can send a handover request to SDN control plane. Then
 establish a new subflow through WiFi interface and turn to simultaneous policy to send data through both interfaces until the connection is stable or cellular subflow fails. Then MPTCP switches to alternate policy or backup policy. 
%Whereas traditional TCP will break and drastically damage user experience in the same situation.
MPTCP realizes a seamless handover that MMT maintains at least one subflow in connection to the server so that the data transmission is not interrupted during handover.

% MPTCP  无法识别 拥塞与 切换带来的 RRT 增长
% Due to MPTCP use congestoin window to perceive the link condition, single MPTCP may regarding mobile scene as handover. Which

\section{Performance Analysis and Simulation }


To verify the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed handover method, 
%we set network selection experimental environment shown as Fig. \ref{fig:HWN} and use MATLAB for simulation. 
we simulated the network selection algorithm and handover mechanism on MATLAB and Mininet tools.
In our simulation, the MMT can run three types of services i.e.,  voice ($s_1$), video ($s_2$), and web browsing ($s_3$),
the candidate heterogeneous networks consist of four kinds of networks, i.e., UMTS ($r_1$), LTE ($r_2$), WLAN ($r_3$), and WiMAX ($r_4$). When the MMT is located in the common coverage of all candidate networks, it can associate with anyone of them.
As for handover execution, we take a handover scenario shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LTE-WLAN} for instance. Assume the user with an MMT moves into indoors from outdoors, the MMT tends to hand over to indoor WLAN from outdoor LTE due to LTE synthetic score decreases.
Next, we first show the performance of FAHP based network selection algorithm, then verify the service continuity during handover using MPTCP.
%We assume a scenaristdoors and tends to handover to indoor WLAN from outdoor LTE, due to 

%Consider there are three service voice ($s_1$), video ($s_2$) and web browsing ($s_3$) running on MMT, the candidate heterogeneous networks consist of four networks: UMTS ($r_1$), LTE ($r_2$), WLAN ($r_3$) and WiMAX ($r_4$). The MMT is located in the common coverage of all networks and can associates to each one of the networks. 
%As for handover management mechanism, we assume a scenario that an MMT moves into indoor environment from outdoors and tends to handover to indoor WLAN from outdoor LTE, the network location is shown as Fig. \ref{fig:HWN}. 
% We take two of the networks as representative beacuse the heterogeneous wireless  networks can be viewed as a collection of access networks providing different QoS in terms of transport layer~\cite{MPTCP}. 
%The experiment is simulated on mininet software.

Fig. \ref{fig:selectedprob} shows the selected probability for networks with different service priority. The service priority vector is set as $\boldsymbol{P}_{\rm web}=[0.1\; 0.3 \; 0.6]$ for web browsing preferred scenario, $\boldsymbol{P}_{\rm video}=[0.1 \; 0.6\; 0.3]$ for video preferred scenario, and $\boldsymbol{P}_{\rm voice}=[0.6 \; 0.3\; 0.1]$ for voice preferred scenario. 
The simulation results are obtained by 1000 times network independent change in each scenario.
%We simulate 1000 times network variation in each scenario,
As RSS based method is irrelevant to service,
% and only tend to select WLAN or LTE with strongest received signal strength, 
the results of RSS based method is shown in an overall manner on the right side in Fig.~\ref{fig:selectedprob}. As Fig. \ref{fig:selectedprob} shows, both the proposed algorithm and MCGDM can select network according to user preferences. When web or video services are preferred, both algorithms tend to select WLAN for high bandwidth and low packet loss rate. When voice services are of high priority,  
the probability of selecting UMTS as the target network is higher for its low delay and low jitter.
 Compared to MCGDM, FAHP based algorithm takes into account service requirements additionally and has more preference for LTE which is consistent with actual network deployment. 
Moreover, the proposed algorithm has a more balanced probability to select each network
 which is beneficial for reducing the access load of a single network.

From dotted lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:handovernumber}, we can see that as moving velocity increases, the handover times of the proposed algorithm decrease significantly due to the increasing handover threshold. 
When moving velocity reaches $10\;\rm m/s$, handover times are limited below 100 thus ping-pong effect is avoided efficaciously.
As moving velocity continues increasing, handover threshold tends to grow slowly to maintain the probability to search better connections.

\subsection{Seamless Handover Mechanism}
%%  如何 进行变量的扫描   原文使用的是 不同的速度与方向   加载 选择网络的算法

In Mininet, we set up an LTE and a WLAN network as Fig.~\ref{fig:LTE-WLAN} shows, in which the LTE base station is located at (0,0), the coverage radius is 1800~$\rm m$, the access point of WLAN is located at (1950,0) and the coverage radius is 300~$\rm m$.
Assume that an MMT moves from (1600,0) to (1900,0) at the speed of~$5\;\rm m/s$. During the moving process, the MMT uses MPTCP. 
		%The MMT first associates to LTE through cellular interface and  when the MMT approaches to the edge of LTE, the connection triggers handover conditions and SDN control plane selects WLAN as  target network to handover. 
		%Then MMT establish an additioinal connection to WLAN on WiFi interface and send data through both subflows simultaneously. As MMT moves out of TLE's coverage range, the cellular subflow would fail and the MMT communicates to server through qualified WLAN. 
The throughput is measured by {\it ifstat} tool.

	\label{fig:seamless}
\end{figure}
The throughput of each MPTCP subflow during handover process is shown in  Fig. \ref{fig:mptcp}. 
As Fig.~\ref{fig:mptcp} shows, the MMT can transmit data through both LTE and WLAN subflows using simultaneous policy in the common area of LTE and WLAN.
The throughputs of subflows have relative violent fluctuation caused by MPTCP interface adjustment.
%From Fig.~\ref{fig:mptcp}, we can see that the throughputs of subflows have relative violent fluctuation when crossing the network edge and fail a subflow.
%This delay is caused by MPTCP interface adjustment.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:contrast} we compare MPTCP based handover mechanism to traditional methods which only uses one interface.
The turquoise line and orange line represent the dataflow throughputs of LTE and WLAN using one interface, respectively.
The dotted line represents total dataflow throughput using MPTCP.
As Fig.~\ref{fig:contrast} shows, using one interface has an inevitable break of connection to re-establish link in heterogeneous networks.
While applying MPTCP mechanism maintains the throughput of subflows during handover with two interfaces simultaneously transmitting data. This ensures a true seamless handover and increases throughput capacity.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed a seamless handover method in SDN based HWN.
The SDN control plane is deployed to periodically collect real-time network attributes and user mobility information.
In network selection stage, we use FAHP to quantize network attribute weights with fuzzy relation and consider user preferences in network selection.
In the handover execution stage, we use MPTCP to %support seamless handover.
maintain at least one subflow connected to the network. 
Simulation results show that the proposed method makes a comprehensive decision on network selection, decreases
up to 17.4\% and 4.5\% handover times compared to RRS based and MCGDM based algorithm. The proposed method avoids ping-pong effect and achieves seamless handover thus improving
user experience.

% yields significant reduction on handover numbers


%In terms of handover times, the proposed method achieves up to 17.4\% and 4.5\% reduction compared to received signal strength based algorithm and fuzzy multiple criteria group decision making based algorithm.
